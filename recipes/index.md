A collection of recipes consisting of one recipe ... for now!

## Recipe: Baking Bread at Home

Due to the "Stay Home" order and limiting grocery visits to once a week, bread is one of the item that usually runs out before the next grocery run is scheduled. Baking bread isn't difficult though and home made bread soon took over during the Coronavirus crisis. Here my recipe.

What you need:

- 500g of flour (whole wheat or white as you prefer)
- 10g of instant yeast
- 5g of table salt
- 3.5 dl of water (warmed up)
- 1 spoon of sunflower oil

Mix flour, yeast and salt in a bowl and spill it on a table forming a crown ("corona" in Spanish; a reminder why we are doing all this). Then pour the lukewarm water (not hot or you will burn your fingers) mixed with the sunflower oil into the crown and slightly start to mix flour with the water without letting leak the crown or you will get a real mess.

Continue kneading the dough which at first will be very sticky until you are able to form a nice ball. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover it with a moistened cloth (not wet) and let it rest up to 2 hours. It should then have been raised to double or triple size (if not ... start over with new yeast).

Shape your dough to your preferred shape of bread and place it on the backing sheet and cover it again with a moistened cloth and let it rest for another hour. Start heating up your oven to 360F shortly before the hour is over. Remove the cloth and put the sheet and dough into the preheated oven for 55 minutes.
