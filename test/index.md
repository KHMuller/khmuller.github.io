## Introduction

The American Bullfrog is a prominent amphibian native to North America. During the mating season, which spans from May to July, male bullfrogs are notably vocal, their calls resonating across ponds and lakes. Typically found in shallow waters, bullfrogs are less frequently observed than [[Green Frog (Lithobates clamitans)]] but are a fascinating subject for wildlife enthusiasts.

## Identification

At first glance, distinguishing a bullfrog from a [[Green Frog (Lithobates clamitans)]] can be challenging. Observe the crest that starts above the eye and extends around the eardrum, leading to the front legs. In [[Green Frog (Lithobates clamitans)]], this crest runs along the back to the hind legs.

## Whereabouts

In ponds around Montreal and Southern Quebec, from late spring to early autumn, I observe them less frequently than green frogs. Typically, I spot them remaining motionless in the shallow water amidst the reeds along the pond's shore.

[[Parc Mont Saint-Bruno]] Lac des Bouleaux is home to both [[Green Frog (Lithobates clamitans)]] and [[American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus)]], though the two species are well separated. To spot Bullfrogs, check the area to the left of the floating platform. The Green Frogs, on the other hand, tend to gather near the opposite corner of the lake, further along the same pathway.

## Photography

Thanks to its tendency to remain motionless even when approached carefully, this species can be photographed with a macro lens â€” my favorite way to capture it. See profile photo.
