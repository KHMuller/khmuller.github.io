A brief introduction about myself: I am a biologist specializing in animal behavior and neurobiology.

My passion lies in nature and wildlife, and I dedicate my free time to capturing photos of fauna and flora, as well as recording videos and sounds of animals.

To reach out to me, please use the [contact form](https://forms.gle/X7ouyRrDDCWLJBV48). I am located in Montreal, Canada.
