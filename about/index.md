## About

Initially planned as test to look into web sites hosted on Github pages, I continue maintaining this website as sandbox to develop new ideas which may later be published in one of my websites in production.

A few words about myself. I am a biologist specialized in animal behavior and neurobiology, working since 1996 in the field of web publishing and digital marketing in the travel industry. I am passionate about nature and wildlife and dedicate my free time to taking photos of fauna and flora, recording videos and sounds of animals. 

To contact me, please DM me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@khmuller). I live in Montreal, Canada.

This site is hosted on Github Pages and serves as example for the short guide how to [Setup Github Pages](https://www.simaec.net/website-development/github-pages-hosting/ "Setup Github Pages").
