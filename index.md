Excited about extending Muuuh's collections of photos and videos with field sound recordings!

## AI vs Humans
Not sure how but I got access to ChatGPT and exploring it. Puzzled how an algorithm can discriminate between an AI or a human answers a question. Google claims that AI generated content performs worse than content generated by humans. I have serious doubt that Google, indeed, is able to discriminate between AI vs Human generated content which questions Google's ability to favor content created by humans.

ChatGPT: "I apologize for the confusion and any inaccuracies in my previous responses. You are correct that Catharus ustulatus is Swainson's Thrush, and that the Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus) is also known as the Dwarf Thrush. I am a machine learning model and I can make mistakes." - **Be aware that ChatGPT doesn't get right the facts**!

## What is the "Pomodoro Technique"?

**The Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/) in the late 1980s. It involves working in short, focused bursts followed by short breaks. Here's how it works:

- Choose a task you want to work on.
- Set a timer for 25 minutes (this is known as a "pomodoro").
- Work on the task for the full 25 minutes, without distractions.
- When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break.
- After four "pomodoros," take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
- Repeat the process until the task is completed.
